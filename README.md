# PRODIGY_DS-02
Repository about Prodigy Data Science Task-02

# Overview
This repository presents a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic Dataset. The goal is to uncover hidden trends, understand feature importance, and clean the data for future machine learning applications.

# Key Objectives

-  Handle and clean missing values  
-  Encode categorical features for analysis  
-  Visualize survival trends across various attributes  
-  Understand correlation between features  
-  Prepare dataset for future machine learning tasks

 # Data Cleaning Steps

-  Dropped irrelevant columns: `Name`, `Ticket`, `Cabin`, `PassengerId`
-  Filled missing `Age` values with **median**
-  Filled missing `Embarked` values with **mode**
-  Encoded `Sex` and `Embarked` into numerical format
-  Created new feature: `FamilySize` = `SibSp + Parch + 1`

# Key Insights

-  **Females** had a significantly higher survival rate than males  
-  **1st class passengers** were more likely to survive than those in 2nd or 3rd class  
-  **Children** and younger passengers had slightly better survival rates  
-  Higher **fare** paid was positively associated with survival  
-  **Embarkation port** had a subtle impact on outcomes  
-  Medium-sized families (2â€“4) had higher survival odds
